V.1.0.0

Remmly's Open Source Social Networking Platform. Is designed for anyone to create a simple social networking site of their own. The platform was first design for Dowling College. Its goal was to keep students connected more on a educational platform. Its very simple and easy to use. Motifying the color scheme and connecting to your own mysql database makes it a breeze to adapt.
